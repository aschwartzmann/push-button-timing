Buttons on a long cord trigger laps in LiveTimeFPV

Minimum Hardware
- Arduino Micro
- 8x 1K Resistors
- 8 Buttons

Buttons connect to 5V on one side and pins 5 through 12 on the otherside. Pin 5 through 12 need a 1k pull down resitor between the pin and ground.

Pin 5 = Pilot 1
Pin 6 = Pilot 2
Pin 7 = Pilot 3
Pin 8 = Pilot 4
Pin 9 = Pilot 5
Pin 10 = Pilot 6
Pin 11 = Pilot 7
Pin 12 = Pilot 8


5V ----- Push Button ------- Pin 5 ----- 1K resitor ------- Ground
